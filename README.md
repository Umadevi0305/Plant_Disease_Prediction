<h1>Overview</h1>

This project focuses on identifying plant diseases using deep learning techniques. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained on an augmented dataset containing images of plants with different diseases. The model can predict the disease category of a plant image and display the results.

<h1>Features</h1>

Preprocessing of training and validation datasets.
A custom CNN architecture for high accuracy.
Training and validation accuracy visualization.
Confusion matrix for performance evaluation.
Model deployment for practical usage.
Supports prediction for single images.

<h1>Dataset</h1>

The dataset used in this project contains 70,295 training images and 17,572 validation images belonging to 38 classes of plant diseases. 
Augmented versions of the dataset are used to improve model performance.
